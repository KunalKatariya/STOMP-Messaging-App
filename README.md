**Group Messaging App**
This is a simple messaging app which uses STOMP (Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) over WebSocket.
I've used SpringBoot to create the application.
To run this on local:
1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project
3. Run the springbootapplication
4. Open https://localhost:8080
